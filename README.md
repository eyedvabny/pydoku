PyDoKu
======

A Python implementation of a Sudoku solver.

## Usage

```
pydoku.py input.csv
```

## Input & Output
The solver expects an input matrix in a CSV format, with 0 designating the blank entries:

```
0,3,5,2,9,0,8,6,4
0,8,2,4,1,0,7,0,3
7,6,4,3,8,0,0,9,0
2,1,8,7,3,9,0,4,0
0,0,0,8,0,4,2,3,0
0,4,3,0,5,2,9,7,0
4,0,6,5,7,1,0,0,9
3,5,9,0,2,8,4,1,7
8,0,0,9,0,0,5,2,6
```

An example input file is provided in the repository as `test_ide.csv`.

The output correspondingly is a CSV file named `solution_$inputfile` where `$inputfile` is the filename of the original template. A solution for the test sudoku provided above would be:

```
1,3,5,2,9,7,8,6,4
9,8,2,4,1,6,7,5,3
7,6,4,3,8,5,1,9,2
2,1,8,7,3,9,6,4,5
5,9,7,8,6,4,2,3,1
6,4,3,1,5,2,9,7,8
4,2,6,5,7,1,3,8,9
3,5,9,6,2,8,4,1,7
8,7,1,9,4,3,5,2,6
```

This file is provided in the repository as `validate_ide.csv` so to avoid name clashes with the solutions generated by the solver.
